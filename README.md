# energy-score
Toolkit to calculate the energy score of trajectory-based predictions

# Installation


# Notebook Descriptions

energy_score_tutorial.ipynb - gives examples of how to calculate the energy score, normalized energy score, and weighted interval score with synthetic examples and using Scenario Modeling Hub projections.

energyscore_fcn.py - function used to calculate the energy score

baseline_model.ipynb - used to generate a naive baseline forecast 

energyscore_flu_rd4.ipynb - used to calculate all scores for 2023-24 Flu Scenario Modeling Hub round and generate analysis for these projections

energyscore_flu_rd4_sampled.ipynb - used to calculate the energy score for trajectories sampled from all trajectories and compare to the full energy score

es_wis_test.ipynb - used to create synthetic experiments that compare the evaluation methods of the energy score and WIS

multiple_targets.ipynb - analyze the multiple targets formulation of the energy score 

score_decomposition.ipynb - used to examine the energy score at single time points

visualize_scenario_trajectories.ipynb - used to create plots visualizing scenario projections
